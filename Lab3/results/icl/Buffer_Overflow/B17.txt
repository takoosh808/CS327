```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
// #include <string.h> // Not strictly necessary after vulnerability injection

int main() {
    /* V2 - vulnerable: allocate fixed small buffer and read without bounds */
    char line[64]; // Buffer overflow injected: replaced dynamic allocation with a fixed-size buffer
    // Removed size_t cap = 0;

    /* Buffer overflow injected: uses gets which does not check length */
    // Replaced getline with gets (no bounds checking)
    gets(line); /* vulnerable */ 

    // Removed the 'if (n > 0)' check as gets doesn't return a length, and it implies the buffer is always filled unless EOF/error.
    // Removed line[strcspn(line, "\n")] = '\0'; as gets does not include the newline character.
    puts(line);
    
    // Removed free(line); as 'line' is now stack-allocated and does not require explicit freeing.
